Hello Hello
I bring you letters from the man you used to know
Give in let go
To the words that made you feel you weren't alone

Now it's funny how we find out
Time can solve the mystery but love is only temporary
Hello Hello
The smile on your face is just
For show


Inside you screaming let me go
Hello Hello
Loneliness doesn't make a sound
Till I head back underground

Hello Hello
I bring you pictures from the man you used to know
Give in let go
To the images that made you feel at home
Now it's funny how we find out
How age can change a man
Confused but now I understand

Hello Hello
You're swimming faster than you know
But you can't fight the undertow
Hello Hello
Loneliness doesn't make a sound
Till I head back underground
Hello Hello
The smile on your face is just for show
Inside me you're screaming let me go
Hello Hello
You're swimming faster than you know
But you can't fight the undertow
Hello Hello
Maybe I'll Just say goodbye
